# Improvisational Readings

Generating random cold readings

This is my system to practice cold reading without scripts by creating your own readings on the fly. The word list contains over 600 words that can be combined randomly and still express anything that you want to.  Here is how it works:

Run prompt.exe with words.txt & the number of prompts to generate.

Example

.\prompt.exe words.txt 3

Prompts:

able

easy

over

Example reading:

You're able to focus on what's important, and it will become easier for you over time.
